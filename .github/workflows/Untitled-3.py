    # to the console. It demonstrates the use of a function
    # in Python.

    # The message is a common example used in programming tutorials.
    # The function is defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name
    # and parentheses. The body of the function is indented.
    # The print function is a built-in function in Python that outputs text to the console.
    # In this case, it outputs the string "Hello, World!".
    # The string is enclosed in double quotes, but single quotes could also be used.
    # The function can be called by using its name followed by parentheses.
    # This will execute the code inside the function and display the message.
    # The function can be called multiple times to print the message again.     
    print("Hello, World!")

# Call the function to execute it and print the message
hello_world()  # Output: Hello, world!
